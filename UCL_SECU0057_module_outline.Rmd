## Introduction

This MSc module introduces students to the field of data science and provides them with the conceptual understanding of the underlying principles. The students will be able to address crime and security problems in a computational manner (e.g., using data-driven crime analysis) and will become critical consumers of data science approaches. It will also allow students to understand the approaches which must be taken to translate these theoretical concepts into real-world applications used by the police and security services, as well in academia to influence and drive government policy.

The techniques covered in this module will be of relevance to students undertaking a data science-related independent research project as well as to those who wish to pursue a career in a data science or analyst role.

## Dates & times

The module is running in Term 2, 2019/2020, from 13 January 2020 - 27 March 2020.

- Time and date: Thursdays, 2-4pm.
- Each session includes a lecture and a tutorial (practical session)

## Structure

The general structure of this module is as follows: there are five content blocks (web data collection, text mining, machine learning, advanced techniques) which each will be covered in weekly 2h-sessions consisting of lectures and tutorials. The lectures cover the approaches on a conceptual (what do they do?) and functional level (how do they work?). The tutorials are practical sessions in which you will learn how to implement the techniques in the R programming language. During the tutorials, we will be there to assist you and help you. 

Each week is (roughly) structured as follows:

- Reading and comprehending the required literature (necessary preparation for the lecture)
- Lecture (weekly content)
- Tutorial (practical implementation of lecture content)
- Homework (helps you consolidate the concepts and build your R skills portfolio)

## Materials

### Software

We will use the R programming language. All packages, required resources and tools needed are openly available and free to download to any computer. We strongly encourage students to bring their own laptops to the tutorials so they can customise their work environment. However, we will have a computer cluster available where you can use the UCL computers.

### Literature

You can find the required reading (as well as suggested further reading) in the table above and on the moodle page.)

For each week, the required literature includes one reading on techniques/tools that are important for data science projects but are not covered in the lectures or tutorials.

### Data

All datasets used are open-source and available without restrictions.


## Assessment

### Class test

- Weight for final grade: 30%
- Learning outcomes tested: (1) demonstrating knowledge of a broader range of analytical techniques used in the field of Security and Crime Science, (2) understanding the purpose, advantages and disadvantages of different forms of data science techniques, (3) interpreting the results of data science techniques.
- Date: 26 March 2020, during the normal lecture+tutorial hours, 2pm-4pm.

**Details:** This 1.5-hour closed-book test covers theoretical, technical and conceptual aspects of the lectures, tutorials and literature. You will be given 15 multiple-choice questions. For each question, there will be five possible answer options. At least one option is correct and you are asked to select all options that apply (i.e. this could be one, two, three, four, or all five options). **If you select the correct - _and only the correct_ - combination of answer options, you will be given ten points for a question.** In total, you can achieve 150 points in this test (transformed to a percentage grade).


### Applied Data Science Project

- Weight for final grade: 70%
- Learning outcomes tested: (1) demonstrating knowledge of a broader range of analytical techniques used in the field of Security and Crime Science, (2) performing data science analyses on crime and/or-security related issues, (3) applying the data science pipeline on crime and/or-security related issues, (4) interpreting and effectively reporting the results of said techniques
- Deadline: 16 April 2020, 4pm.
- Page limit: See below.

> _This assessment is the capstone project of the module. It requires you to address a research problem in the full data science workflow (e.g., obtaining the data, processing the data, modelling the data, building predictive models, reporting on the findings, interpreting the outcomes). You will write a brief report on your project (a template will be provided) and you have to submit the R code needed to reproduce your findings. After passing this assessment, you will have the demonstrated the skills to solve a problem using data science techniques._

#### Feedback 

A full project is a major step in your data science skills career. To help you in the process, you will receive feedback from us on a concept draft of your project. The deadline for the concept draft is **9 March 2020 (4pm)** via Turn-it-in on moodle. The requirements for the feedback submission are available on moodle. _The submission of the concept draft accounts for 10% of the Applied Data Science Project._ 


#### Assessment topic

This year's topic is authorship attribution. Recently, an area of digital forensics closely connected to NLP that seeks to identify who wrote a piece of text/novel/song/etc. has received considerable attention (e.g., [Why Molière most likely did write his plays](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaax5489.abstract), [Researcher uses AI to unravel the mystery of Shakespeare’s co-author](https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2019/11/27/ai-shakespeare-henry-viii/), and [Plecháč, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05652)).

With more techniques at the researchers' disposal, this area is likely to impact on how we do digital forensic investigations (e.g. when trying to find who wrote a post). The project requires you to conduct your own authorship attribution project including (web) data collection, text processing and text mining, and approaches to identify authorship (e.g. through machine learning). _The exact nature of the project is up to you._ **The only restrictions on the topic and scope are: you must not use novels or Twitter as the source of data, and you must have at least 1000 data points (e.g. texts/paragraphs/etc.) for each of at least 50 authors.**.

Further details:

- the project should be on authorship attribution (not author profiling)
- all steps in this project must be reproducible with your code supplement
- the project should have a large-scale focus (i.e. not a case study with one document)
- all three core areas of this module should be used: web data collection, text mining, machine learning


#### The code supplement

Submit your R code in the form of a commented R notebook. To ensure that no code is lost and that we can review all code equally, submit your code as an anonymised view-only version on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). Create a private repository, upload your code as an R notebook and create an anonymised, view-only link that you include in your report (for a guide on creating that link, see [here](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930333-Create-a-View-only-Link-for-a-Project)). For details on reporting your code as an R notebook, you can consult these guides: [guide 1](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/notebook.html), [guide 2](http://uc-r.github.io/r_notebook).

#### The report

For this assignment, you are asked to report your findings in the form of a short paper. Specifically, you should use the template of the ACL conference proceedings (these can be downloaded  [here for Latex and Word](http://acl2020.org/downloads/acl2020-templates.zip) or can be imported into Overleaf [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acl-2020-proceedings-template/zsrkcwjptpcd)).

Additional requirements for the report:

- use the ACL style guidelines (easiest through the templates)
- the **page limit is 8 content pages** + unlimited pages for the reference list
- use the ACL referencing style (this is available in reference managers like Zotero or handled directly in Overleaf) - i.e. adhere to their font type, font size and heading guidelines.
- use the anonymous submission version which contains line numbers
- the paper must contain only your examination number in the author line
- include a footnote with an anonymised view-only link to your code on the OSF (see above).
- submit the report via moodle as a pdf file using the following file name: _SECU0057_12345.pdf_ (replace 12345 with your examination number)


#### Deliverables

- Concept draft (9 Mar 2020)
- Project report (16 April 2020)
- Code supplement (16 April 2020)
